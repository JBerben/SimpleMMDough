> SimpleMMDough is a Python CLI tool that is able to interact with the player markets on the popular Mobile and Web Browser Game &#34;SimpleMMO&#34;. It keeps track of market transactions and even automates the buying and selling process, using the market information gathered, to sell items for a slightly higher price, and buying them at a slightly lower price in order to make a consistent profit.
